 In the update_todo_by_id(), this handles incoming PATCH requests from the demo site which is given to us. The function should accept any ID of the todo that should be updated and a todo request object that has the desired changes. The function should search for the matching todo object in your todo list and update it with the received changes. In the to do list and item can be added when its added it can be deleted by selecting the item its crossed out and then the recycle bin icon is selected and then the item is deleted. In my delete handler should respond with a JSON object indicating that an object has been deleted along with the 200 OK status code. 
 In my PATCH handler responded with the entire todo object after being updated along with the 200 OK status code. 

If no todo object with the provided ID, is not found, the PATCH handler should respond with a 404 Not Found status code.

Overral the reason the code was written is to become more familiar with the FastAPI python framework and to create functions that will used to handle incoming HTTP requests.

my favorite pokemon is picakchu, the reason is the pokemon is friendly, and loyal and can be very helpful during dangerous encounters with enemies. And also the mere fact it can produce electricity within itself.
